# gogrep

WIP: this is an attempt to move modified [gogrep](https://github.com/mvdan/gogrep) from the [go-ruleguard](https://github.com/quasilyte/go-ruleguard) project, so it can be used outside of the ruleguard as a library.

## Acknowledgements

The original gogrep is written by the [Daniel Mart√≠](https://github.com/mvdan).
